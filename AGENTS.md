# Agent Instructions

This repository is a Go full-stack with Vite React TypeScript, Postgres, and Docker template derived from `subculture-collective/project-template`.

## Priorities

1. Keep the template runnable and minimal.
2. Preserve Open Pilot issue and PR templates.
3. Keep generated caches, secrets, and local data out of git.
4. Update this file and `README.md` when stack conventions change.

## Verification

Run:

```bash
make verify
```

Use narrower commands only when an issue explicitly asks for a smaller check.

Draft issue forms do not approve pickup. Apply `ready-for-agent` and `agent:queued` only after reviewing scope and verification, or use the reviewed ready-for-pickup form. Treat `ready-for-agent` alone and assignment to `open-pilot` as pickup approval when enabled.

`make typecheck` checks TypeScript without emitting application files. Formatting targets apply only to stacks with an actual formatter.
